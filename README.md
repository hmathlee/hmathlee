# About Me

My name is Hoseok Lee, and I'm a fourth-year Data Science undergrad at the University of Waterloo! 

### Current Projects

**Retrieval-Based Study App:** Leverages LangChain's agent capabilities, combining search tools with retrieval from Chroma's vector database to help students study. Students can upload their course notes (currently supports PDF files) and receive a context-specific explanation of concepts.
