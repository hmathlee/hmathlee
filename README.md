# About Me

My name is Hoseok Lee. I did my Bachelor's Degree in Data Science at the University of Waterloo.

### Current Projects

**Retrieval-Based Study App:** Leverages LangChain's agent capabilities, combining search tools with retrieval from Chroma's vector database to help students study. Students can upload their course notes (currently supports PDF files) and receive a context-specific explanation of concepts.
