### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Hoseok Lee, and I'm a fourth-year Data Science undergrad at the University of Waterloo! 

ðŸ“§ Feel free to contact me at h349lee@uwaterloo.ca.

### Current Projects

### Interests

I love anything and everything machine learning. I've worked on various ML tasks during my internships; to name a few:
ðŸ’¡ Performing object detection using a YOLOv5 model
ðŸ’¡ Building an image perspective alignment pipeline with OpenCV-Python postprocessing algorithms
ðŸ’¡ Conducting research on a **active learning** approach. Active learning is a subset of machine learning that dynamically queries annotation sources to label data. Since a model can be trained using only as much data as necessary with this approach, active learning results in better data efficiency.

I'm also really into math. My favorite courses at Waterloo were those that delved into the derivations behind statistical and machine learning algorithms.

Aside from that, you'll probably find me pumping iron at the gym or playing piano.
